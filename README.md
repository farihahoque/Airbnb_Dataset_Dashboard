-  Second visualization is map of the area with given zipcodes.This also shows the number of reviews with the prices in that area.We can see that airbnb in central business district is the most pricy to rent,however it has the least amount of reviews.On the contrary,North Beacon Hill has the most reviews but least pricy.
-  Revenue per week is illustrated here.The line graph is upward but price flactuates a lot.So in the beginning week ,the price is minimun but due to holiday price to rent airbnb in december is highest.
